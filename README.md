## Insight
* I wanted to make this app as simple, easy, and straightforward to use as possible. This is why the app does not require authentication and does not include common paint app tools such as rectangle or circle fills.
* I added the "Join Random Room" button as an experimental feature. I believe that it adds potential entertainment value.
* I see this app's potential as
    1. A communication tool
    2. An entertaining app to use with friends
    3. An educational tool
    4. An entertaining social / online experiment

## Future Features That I Will Add One Day (In Priority Order)
* Public / Private Room Toggle 
* Undo / Redo Button
* Eraser

## Known Issues
* Scroll function does not work properly on mobile.
* Interaction select buttons do not highlight properly in production builds.
* Privacy Policy needs revising.

## Development Tools
* React
* Node.js
